                <p class="text-small">Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” This dialogue brings very mature meaning in terms of improving professional life. It is a famous dialogue from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off released in 1986. This dialogue holds the truth of every person, the way we all are messing with our personal and professional life is just terrible. We have to make a balance between professional life and personal life, take time to explore yourself, relish the vacation and travel the outer world. </p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag">In 1659, the prominent Bijapuri nobleman, Afzal Khan, was assigned the task of militarily defeating Shivaji.

            He embarked on the task by provisioning a large force and '... determined to make war pay for war, by carrying out rapid cavalry raids' on well endowed temples en route from Bijapur to the Maratha strongholds.
            
            But the task was by no means an easy one for the Bijapur army: 'Shiva's military strength was far from despicable; and the Bijapuri nobles shrank from the idea of a campaign among the hills and jungles of the Western Ghats.' </p>
